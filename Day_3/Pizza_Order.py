print("Thank you for choosing Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input(" What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L")
add_pepperoni = input("  Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input(" Do you want extra cheese? Y or N")

bill = 0

if size == "S":
    bill = 15
elif size == "M":
    bill = 20
